"""Canonicalisation helpers for the determinism loop (Loop A).

A diagnostic script is "deterministic" when the SAME database state yields the
SAME `--json` result. Two kinds of legitimate drift must be normalised away
first, or the assertion produces false failures:

1. **Volatile values** — live measurements (query latency, PostgreSQL hit ratios
   and scan counters). Removed entirely.
2. **Volatile ordering** — lists that are sorted by one of those volatile values
   can legitimately reorder. Sorted into a stable order; contents still compared.

Everything else is compared exactly, so a real nondeterminism bug (unsorted
output, dict ordering, sampling, parallel workers) still fails loudly.
