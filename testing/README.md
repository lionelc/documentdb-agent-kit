# DocumentDB Agent-Kit — Regression Test Framework

This framework guards the agent-kit's **diagnostic skills/scripts** against
regression. It is modelled on the [Cosmos DB agent-kit `testing-v2`] framework
but adapted for a *diagnostic inspector* rather than an app generator.

Where the Cosmos framework is **contract-first** ("define an API contract, have
an agent build an app, validate the app against the contract"), this framework
is **fixture-first**:

> Seed a database with **known planted problems**, run an agent-kit diagnostic
> script against the live DocumentDB container, and assert the script's findings
> match a fixed `expected-findings.yaml` contract.

Because the diagnostic scripts emit deterministic output (JSON or stable text
markers), the contracts are exact — this is a stronger regression signal than
testing free-form LLM output.

```
seed fixture (known issues)  ──►  run kit script  ──►  assert vs contract
   fixture.js                     scripts/*.sh          expected-findings.yaml
```

## Layout

```
testing/
  conftest.py              # CLI options (--container, --keep-db) + global fixtures
  pytest.ini              # discovery + markers
  requirements.txt
  run.sh                  # convenience: venv + install + run
  harness/
    kit.py                # run_script(), seed(), drop_db(), container checks
    conftest_base.py      # make_seeded_db_fixture() factory
  scenarios/
    _scenario-template/   # copy this to start a new scenario
    ecommerce-redundant-indexes/   # index-redundancy-finder.sh  (JSON contract)
    ecommerce-data-integrity/      # data-integrity-check.sh     (text markers)
    ecommerce-missing-index/       # perf-advisor.sh             (COLLSCAN audit)
    ecommerce-healthy-indexes/     # false-positive guard (well-indexed DB -> 0 findings)
    json-contract/                 # --json shape/validity guard (all 5 scripts)
```

Each scenario directory contains:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `SCENARIO.md` | Fixed description of what is planted and what must be detected |
| `fixture.js` | Deterministic seed that plants the known issues |
| `expected-findings.yaml` | The "answer key" contract |
| `conftest.py` | Builds the scenario's `seeded_db` fixture (one line) |
| `tests/test_*.py` | Asserts the kit script's findings match the contract |

## Prerequisites

- A running DocumentDB local container (default name `documentdb-local`,
  gateway port `10260`, PG port `9712`). Override via env:
  `DOCDB_CONTAINER`, `DOCDB_PORT`, `DOCDB_PG_PORT`, `DOCDB_USER`, `DOCDB_PASSWORD`.
- Python 3.10+, Docker CLI on PATH.

## Run

```bash
# one-shot (creates a venv, installs deps, runs everything)
bash testing/run.sh

# or manually
python3 -m venv testing-venv
testing-venv/bin/pip install -r testing/requirements.txt
cd testing && ../testing-venv/bin/python -m pytest

# a single scenario
cd testing && ../testing-venv/bin/python -m pytest scenarios/ecommerce-redundant-indexes -v

# point at a different container, and keep the seeded DB for inspection
cd testing && ../testing-venv/bin/python -m pytest --container my-docdb --keep-db
```

If the container isn't running, the whole suite **skips** (it does not fail).

## The regression loop (for skill/script changes)

1. Edit a skill rule or a `scripts/*.sh` diagnostic.
2. Run `pytest`. Green = behavior preserved.
3. A red test means the change altered detection behavior. Either:
   - it's a **bug** → fix the script, or
   - it's an **intended** behavior change → update the scenario's
     `expected-findings.yaml` *deliberately* (the answer key is the record of
     intended behavior).

This makes every change to the answer key an explicit, reviewable decision.

## Adding a scenario

See [`CREATE-SCENARIO.md`](CREATE-SCENARIO.md). In short: copy
`scenarios/_scenario-template/`, write a `fixture.js` that plants known issues,
encode the answer key in `expected-findings.yaml`, and assert it in
`tests/`.

## Multi-model (agent) layer — optional, complementary

This framework deterministically tests the **scripts** that skills invoke. To
also regression-test how a *frontier-model agent* uses the skills (does it pick
the right tool and read the findings correctly?), layer a prompt-matrix eval
(e.g. promptfoo with `providers:` across OpenAI/Anthropic/Google, or Inspect AI
for sandboxed tool use) on top. The deterministic script layer here is the
foundation; the model layer is additive.
