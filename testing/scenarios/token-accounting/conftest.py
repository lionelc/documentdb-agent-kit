"""Scenario conftest: token accounting needs NO database.

The root conftest has an autouse fixture that skips (or aborts) when the
DocumentDB container is unavailable. This scenario tests pure arithmetic over a
synthetic SQLite file, so it overrides that fixture with a no-op. Defining a
fixture of the same name in a nested conftest shadows the parent's.

The practical benefit: these tests run in CI on every PR with no Docker, no
container and no credentials.
