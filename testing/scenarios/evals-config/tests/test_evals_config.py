"""Static validation of the Loop B eval + experiment configs.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`vally experiment run --dry-run` validates the matrix structure but does NOT
check that the skill paths point at anything real. That gap produced a live bug
while this scenario's sibling files were being written: the experiment
referenced `../skills/query-performance-tuning`, which exists on a different
branch. The dry run passed.

That is the worst possible failure mode for an A/B test. A treatment arm whose
skills silently fail to load is just a second control arm — and it would have
produced a confident, published, completely wrong conclusion of "the kit makes
no difference".

These tests are cheap, need no container, no credentials and no network, and
they run on every PR.
