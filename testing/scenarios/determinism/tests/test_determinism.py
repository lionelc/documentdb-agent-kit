"""Determinism contract (Loop A) — the deterministic half of the kit's testing.

The diagnostic scripts are *tools*, not agents: given the same database state
they must return the same answer every time. This scenario runs each script
N times (N from expected-findings.yaml) and asserts the canonicalised `--json`
results are identical.

Three traps this suite is explicitly designed to avoid:

1. **False determinism** — a script that finds nothing is identical every run.
   `must_find` asserts the output is non-empty, so the comparison is meaningful.
2. **Over-broad normalisation** — the volatile-field allowlist is small,
   measured, and documented in expected-findings.yaml. Drift outside it fails.
3. **A test that cannot fail** — `test_injected_drift_is_detected` is a negative
   control proving the comparison actually catches a difference.
