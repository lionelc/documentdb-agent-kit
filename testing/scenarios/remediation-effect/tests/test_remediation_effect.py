"""Before/after remediation grading — the strongest rung of the grading ladder.

WHY THIS SCENARIO EXISTS
------------------------
Most "did the skill help?" questions get answered by asking a model to judge the
answer. That is the weakest possible grader: it is subjective, expensive,
non-deterministic, and vulnerable to output that reads well but is wrong.

For diagnostics we can do far better, because the database is the oracle. We can
apply the advice and MEASURE whether the database improved. This scenario closes
the whole chain objectively:

    1. the tool detects a real defect          (else "improvement" is meaningless)
    2. the fix is DERIVED FROM THE TOOL'S OWN OUTPUT, not hardcoded here
    3. applying it measurably improves the plan
    4. the tool then agrees the defect is gone
    5. nothing else got worse (no new redundancy, identical results)

Step 2 is what makes this a test of the KIT rather than a test of PostgreSQL.
If someone deletes the `collscans` reporting from perf-advisor, this suite stops
being able to derive a fix and fails — as it should.

THE METRIC
----------
Scan amplification = totalDocsExamined / nReturned. See expected-findings.yaml
for why raw "documents examined" is the wrong metric on this engine.
