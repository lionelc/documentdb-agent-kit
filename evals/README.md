# `evals/` — Loop B: skill-efficacy evaluation

Loop B is built on **[Vally](https://aka.ms/vally)** (`@microsoft/vally-cli`,
MIT, pinned in [`package.json`](package.json)) — Microsoft's evaluation platform
for AI agents. Vally gives us, natively: multi-model runs, skills on/off
variants, an objective **`skill-invocation`** grader, real token/AI-credit
accounting from API `response.usage`, and LLM-judge graders for the cases where
nothing objective exists.

## Layout

```
evals/
├── package.json                  # pins @microsoft/vally-cli
├── documentdb-skills/
│   └── eval.yaml                 # stimuli + graders (the contract)
└── vally-results/                # run artifacts — gitignored, never committed
```

## Prerequisites

```bash
cd evals && npm install
export VALLY_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT=1 DO_NOT_TRACK=1   # see "Telemetry" below
```

**For real (non-mock) runs** the Copilot SDK executor needs an auth token in the
environment (`COPILOT_SDK_AUTH_TOKEN`); without it a run fails with
`Session was not created with authentication info or custom provider`.
Real runs consume AI credits.

## Running

```bash
npm run lint          # static validation — no agent, no cost
npm run eval:mock     # mock executor — free, but see the WARNING below
npm run eval          # real model — costs AI credits, needs auth

# filter by tag
npx vally eval -e documentdb-skills/eval.yaml --tag kind=anti-trigger
```

## ⚠️ The mock executor cannot score skill activation

`--executor mock` never invokes skills (`Skills used 0`). That means:

- **positive-trigger stimuli always FAIL on mock**, and
- **anti-trigger stimuli always PASS on mock — vacuously.**

So a green anti-trigger result on mock proves *nothing*, exactly like a
diagnostic script that "passes" determinism by finding nothing (see
[`../testing/scenarios/determinism/`](../testing/scenarios/determinism/)).

**Use mock only to validate the plumbing** — that the spec parses, skill paths
resolve, graders are wired. **Any real signal requires a real executor.**

## What Phase 1 covers

Skill **routing**: does the right skill activate for a given phrasing, and does
**no** DocumentDB skill activate for an unrelated question?

This was chosen deliberately as the first eval because it is:
- the **cheapest** useful signal,
- graded **objectively** (`skill-invocation` is binary — no LLM judge needed), and
- otherwise only ever verified by hand.

| Stimulus | Tag | Asserts |
|---|---|---|
| slow query on `db.orders` | `kind=trigger` | `documentdb-query-optimizer` **required** |
| array field + 30-day expiry | `kind=trigger` | `documentdb-indexing` **required** |
| pool exhaustion / timeouts | `kind=trigger` | `documentdb-connection` **required** |
| PostgreSQL partial index | `kind=anti-trigger` | **no** DocumentDB skill called |
| CSS centering | `kind=anti-trigger` | **no** DocumentDB skill called |

### Honest measurement: skills are never hinted

`environment.skills` makes the skills *discoverable* exactly as an installed user
would have them — the prompt **never tells the agent to use them**. This measures
the skill's **organic** effect rather than a hinted best case. (Protocol borrowed
from the MSBench `cosmos-sdk-skills` runner.)

## The two evals

| Eval | Question | Grader | Reproducible? |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`documentdb-skills/eval.yaml`](documentdb-skills/eval.yaml) | does the **right skill fire**? | `skill-invocation` (binary) | yes |
| [`documentdb-quality/quality-eval.yaml`](documentdb-quality/quality-eval.yaml) | is the **guidance any good**? | blinded cross-model `panel` | **no, by construction** |

The first is cheap and exact but cannot tell good advice from bad — a skill can
fire perfectly and still give poor guidance. The second closes that gap and is
the one place in the kit where an LLM judge is the right instrument, because
"was this explanation clear and correct" is genuinely a matter of degree.

### How the judge is kept honest

Five guards, each enforced by a test in
`testing/scenarios/evals-config/` so they cannot quietly regress:

| Guard | Why |
|---|---|
| **3 judges, 3 vendors** | models favour their own output; no model may be the sole judge of a run it could have produced |
| **median, not mean** | one miscalibrated judge must not swing the verdict |
| **blinded prompt** | a judge told which arm it is grading will find reasons to agree |
| **anchored criteria + per-stimulus rubric** | "rate 1–5" is not a measurement; both runs must be scored against the same yardstick |
| **correctness is a `required` gate** | a fluent, confident, WRONG answer must fail however well it reads |

`technical_correctness` also carries more weight than any presentational
criterion, so style can never outvote accuracy.

> ⚠️ **The mock executor is close to useless for this eval.** It invokes no
> skills *and* cannot call the judge models, so every stimulus scores 0 with

## Grading policy — match the grader to the claim

LLM-as-a-judge is a legitimate and widely used grader, and Loop B relies on one
for the qualitative dimensions no assertion can capture. The ordering below is
about **fit**: prefer a criterion that is reproducible and hard to satisfy by
accident, and reach for a judge when the thing being graded is genuinely a
matter of degree rather than a fact about the system.

Prefer, in order:

1. deterministic / exact match → `../testing/` (Loop A)
2. **measured before/after delta** → apply the advice, re-measure (`run-command`)
3. structural assertion on the artifact → `program`, `file-matches`
4. semantic equivalence vs a golden output
5. **behavioural assertion** → `skill-invocation`, `tool-call`, `metric-threshold` ← *Phase 1 lives here*
6. contract conformance
7. LLM-as-a-judge → for qualitative dimensions (clarity, targeting, tone); blinded, cross-model panel, and always reported next to an objective score so its reliability is visible

A useful trick: convert 7 → 2/3 by **constraining the ask**. "Explain how to
speed this up" is judge-only prose; "emit the exact `createIndex(...)` you
recommend" is executable, so it can be applied and measured.

## Telemetry

Vally collects pseudonymous usage telemetry (including a persistent device
identifier) **by default**. Always export `VALLY_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT=1` /
`DO_NOT_TRACK=1` — the npm scripts assume you have.

## Next (not yet built)

- Real-model matrix: `claude-opus-5` × `gpt-5.6-sol` × `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`,
  skills vs control, `--runs 5` (`vally experiment` + `vally compare`)
- Before/after graders that apply a recommended index and re-measure `explain()`,
  paired with `index-redundancy-finder.sh --json` as an anti-gaming guard
- CI: Loop A every PR; Loop B on dispatch/schedule
