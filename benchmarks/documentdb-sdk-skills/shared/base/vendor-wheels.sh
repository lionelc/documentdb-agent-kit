#!/usr/bin/env bash
# vendor-wheels.sh — download the verifier + reference-app wheels on the HOST
# so the image can install them with no network access.
#
# WHY
# ---
# `files.pythonhosted.org` is not reachable from inside Docker's VM on this
# network (blocked by IT policy), although the host itself can reach it. So the
# wheels are resolved once, here, and copied into the build context.
#
# This is not a workaround bolted on: it is how the image SHOULD be built.
# The benchmark promises the agent no internet during grading, and a pinned
# wheel set makes the image reproducible months later when a fresh PyPI
# resolution might not be.
#
# If the public index is blocked on the host too, set PIP_INDEX_URL to an
# approved internal mirror before running, e.g. an Azure Artifacts feed that
# proxies PyPI:
#
#   export PIP_INDEX_URL="https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/<org>/_packaging/<feed>/pypi/simple/"
#
# Usage: bash vendor-wheels.sh [dest-dir]
