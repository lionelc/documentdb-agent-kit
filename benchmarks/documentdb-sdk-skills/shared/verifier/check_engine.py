"""Engine-level checks — the second observation plane.

WHY THIS FILE IS THE DIFFERENTIATOR
-----------------------------------
The Cosmos benchmark's own docs concede that client-side properties "a
single-node local emulator CANNOT prove behaviorally" have to drop down to
static source-code regex — the weakest grader they use.

DocumentDB gives us a way out. It is MongoDB-compatible on the surface and
PostgreSQL underneath, and the verifier can talk to BOTH. So instead of
grepping for `create_index(` and hoping, we ask the engine what actually
happened:

  * `explain()` through the Mongo API  -> was the query planned as an index
    scan, and how many documents did it read per document returned?
  * `pg_stat_user_indexes`             -> did the index actually get USED, or
                                          is it dead weight that only costs
                                          write throughput?

An agent can fake the source. It cannot fake the engine's own statistics.

THE METRIC: SCAN AMPLIFICATION
------------------------------
`totalDocsExamined / nReturned`. Raw "documents examined" is the wrong metric
on this engine: measured on DocumentDB Local, the planner picks an index scan
even for very unselective predicates, so `examined` mostly reflects how many
rows legitimately match rather than whether the index helped.

    amount > 490 (selective)    IXSCAN  examined=760    returned=760
    amount > 10  (unselective)  IXSCAN  examined=19960  returned=19960

Both are healthy — they read only rows they return. Amplification captures
that independently of selectivity.

DELIBERATELY NOT GRADED
-----------------------
Index-backed SORT and covered queries. The DocumentDB gateway pins the
experimental GUCs that enable them (`enableIndexOrderbyPushdown`,
`enableNewCompositeIndexOpClass`, `defaultUseCompositeOpClass`) off per
session, and `ALTER SYSTEM` plus an index rebuild does not change the
Mongo-API plan. Grading advice the harness cannot demonstrate would be worse
than not grading it.
