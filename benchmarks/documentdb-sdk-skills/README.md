# documentdb-sdk-skills

A **skill-efficacy benchmark**: does a coding agent obey Azure DocumentDB best
practices when it merely *has* the [documentdb-agent-kit](../../README.md)
skills installed?

> **Status: built and verified locally; not yet submitted to MSBench.** Both
> images build offline, the oracle scores 1, and both an empty and a
> working-but-naive submission score 0. See
> [Verification status](#verification-status).

## The question

Not "is the kit good?" — unfalsifiable. This one:

> Given the same task, the same model and the same environment, does an agent
> **with** the DocumentDB skills installed produce a measurably better service
> than one **without** — and what did each cost?

## Two arms, always

| Benchmark | Skills installed | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `documentdb-sdk-skills` | yes, discoverable, **never mentioned** | treatment |
| `documentdb-sdk-skills-noskills` | none | control |

The control arm is a **separately registered benchmark**, not a runtime flag.
That mirrors the platform's existing `skillsbench` / `skillsbenchnoskills`
convention.

**Only the delta is publishable.** An absolute pass@k on either arm alone
cannot be interpreted — you cannot tell a good kit from an easy task.

## The organic-discovery protocol

`shared/ces/runner.sh` copies the skills into the agent's personal skills
directory as normally discoverable skills, then drives the **default** agent
with **no hint** to use them. `instruction.md` is deliberately silent about
indexing, ESR, connection pooling, schema versioning and type discriminators —
a static test (`testing/scenarios/benchmark-config/`) fails the build if any of
those words appear in it.

Hinting would turn "does an installed kit get applied?" into "can the model
follow an instruction?" — a much easier question with a much less useful answer.

The instruction *does* state the scale requirement ("millions of orders", the
customer lookup is the hot path). That is a requirement, not a hint: without it,
choosing not to index would be a defensible engineering decision rather than a
miss.

## What gets evaluated

| # | Category | Module | Strength |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Engine behaviour** | `check_engine.py` | ★★★ strongest |
| 2 | **Live behaviour** | `check_behavior.py` | ★★★ |
| 3 | Data shape & indexing | `check_documentdb.py` | ★★ structural |
| 4 | API conformance | `check_api.py` | ★★ |
| 5 | Security hygiene | `check_skills.py` | ★★ |
| 6 | Client configuration | `check_source.py` | ★ static — used only where no runtime signal exists |

### One advantage this benchmark has over its Cosmos ancestor

The Cosmos benchmark notes that client-side properties "a single-node local
emulator **cannot** prove behaviorally" are checked with static source regex
instead — ~520 lines of it. Given their platform that is the right call; a
static check beats no coverage. It is simply easier to satisfy by accident than
a runtime observation is.

DocumentDB lets us avoid the trade-off. It is MongoDB-compatible on the surface
and **PostgreSQL underneath**, and the verifier talks to *both*. So instead of
grepping for `create_index(` and hoping:

- `explain()` through the Mongo API → was the query planned as an index scan,
  and how many documents did it read per document returned?
- `pg_stat_user_indexes` → did the index actually get **used**, or is it dead
  weight costing write throughput?

An agent can fake the source. It cannot fake the engine's own statistics.
Our `check_source.py` is ~130 lines, not 520, because almost everything moved
to a stronger rung.

### The metric: scan amplification

`totalDocsExamined / nReturned`.

Raw "documents examined" is the **wrong** metric here — measured on DocumentDB
Local, the planner picks an index scan even for very unselective predicates:

| Query | Plan | Examined | Returned |
|---|---|---|---|
| `amount > 490` (selective) | IXSCAN | 760 | 760 |
| `amount > 10` (unselective) | IXSCAN | 19,960 | 19,960 |

Both are healthy: they read only rows they return. Amplification captures that
independently of selectivity — 2000× before an index, 1× after.

### Grading at realistic volume

The contract seeds only 4 rows through the API, but the engine checks run
against **20,000** filler documents loaded by the verifier
(`bulk_filler` in `conftest.py`), followed by `ANALYZE`.

This is necessary, not a workaround: on a 4-document collection a sequential
scan genuinely *is* cheaper, PostgreSQL is right to choose it, and the oracle
itself would fail. The task tells the agent the service runs against millions
of orders, so the verifier must grade at a size where that statement has
consequences.

## Cost metrics

MSBench's reward is binary — it says whether a submission complied, not what it
cost. The verifier writes `$OUTPUT_DIR/custom_metrics.json` (MSBench's
first-class per-instance hook, surfaced by
`msbench-cli report --output report.json`) with token usage harvested from the
Copilot CLI's own session store:

| Metric | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `tokens_fresh_input` | input **actually billed** at the uncached rate |
| `tokens_input` / `tokens_cache_read` | raw counts, for transparency |
| `cache_read_share_pct` | how much of the payload was amortised by caching |
| `ai_credits` | the money number |
| `agent_turns` / `agent_requests` | round trips |
| `credits_to_green` | cost of a **passing** run (absent when it failed) |
| `checks_<category>_passed/_total` | which rung failed, per category |
| `tokens_available` | `0` when harvesting failed — so a missing value is never read as free |

**Do not quote `tokens_input` as the cost of a skill.** `cache_read_tokens` is a
*subset* of `input_tokens`, and the skill payload is cached after first use — on
a real session, 91% of input was cache reads. `tokens_fresh_input` is the honest
figure.

`credits_to_green` is emitted **only** for a run that passed; otherwise an agent
that gave up early would look like the cheapest one.

`registry.json` is **required** by the live platform — the Cosmos benchmark's
registration predates it and would be rejected today.

## Reward model

`tests/test.sh` writes `0` or `1` to `/logs/verifier/reward.txt`. A run scores
`1` only when **every** mandatory check passes. A CTRF report
(`/logs/verifier/ctrf.json`) records per-check results so a failure is
diagnosable without re-running.

### No verification is skipped, deliberately

The platform's own `skillsbench` config carries several
`skip = "oracle", reason = "Non-deterministic: …"` entries. Under a **binary**
reward one flaky check corrupts the entire signal, so `[tasks.skip-verification]`
here is empty and a test enforces that: a check that cannot be made
deterministic must be **removed**, not skipped.

## Reproducing the results

```bash
bash build.sh              # build both images (offline, from vendored wheels)
bash verify-controls.sh    # oracle=1, empty=0, naive=0 — asserts all three
```

`pass@k`, in [`docs/REPORT.md` §4](docs/REPORT.md).

## Building and running locally

```bash
cd benchmarks/documentdb-sdk-skills
docker build -f shared/base/Dockerfile -t documentdb-orders-base:latest .
cd tasks/orders-api-python
docker build -f environment/Dockerfile -t documentdb-orders-api-python:latest .

# Positive control: the oracle must score 1
docker run --rm documentdb-orders-api-python:latest \
  bash -c '/solution/solve.sh && /tests/test.sh; cat /logs/verifier/reward.txt'

# Negative control: an empty /app must score 0
docker run --rm documentdb-orders-api-python:latest \
  bash -c '/tests/test.sh; cat /logs/verifier/reward.txt'
```

`--backend local` lets MSBench run harbor-native benchmarks entirely on your
machine, so the whole benchmark can be iterated **without** pushing to the
internal registry:

```bash
pip install "msbench-cli[harbor]"
msbench-cli run --benchmark documentdb-sdk-skills \
  --dataset msbench-registration/documentdb-sdk-skills/dataset.jsonl \
  --backend local
```

## Results

Committed under [`results/`](results/) with provenance, so any number can be
traced to its run. Effectiveness results must be committed **in arm pairs** —
a treatment score with no control is not a result.

**No MSBench run has been executed yet**, so there is no effectiveness data.
[`docs/REPORT.md`](docs/REPORT.md) records what has been measured (grader
validation), what has not, and how to generate the real report with
[`report.py`](report.py) once both arms have run.

## Verification status

Verified by running, not by inspection:

| Claim | Status |
|---|---|
| Registration matches the live platform schema | ✅ read from the central repo; asserted by tests |
| Task follows the Harbor layout | ✅ asserted by tests |
| Instruction contains no hints | ✅ asserted (mutation-verified) |
| Cost metrics agree with the Loop B module | ✅ asserted (mutation-verified) |
| Verifier parses as Python 3.10 (the image's interpreter) | ✅ asserted in CI |
| Images build | ✅ base + task, offline from vendored wheels |
| **Oracle scores 1** | ✅ **REWARD=1, 31 checks passed** |
| **Empty submission scores 0** | ✅ **REWARD=0** |
| **A working-but-naive app scores 0** | ✅ **REWARD=0, 10 checks failed** |
| Cost metrics emitted | ✅ `custom_metrics.json` with per-category counts |
| Submitted to MSBench | ⬜ not yet |

### The discrimination that matters

An empty `/app` failing is a weak result — it proves only that the harness
notices missing files. The real test is a submission that **works**: correct
HTTP behaviour, correct persistence, no DocumentDB best practices.

That app passes **every** API and behavioural check and still scores 0, failing
exactly the ten skill-specific ones:

```
check_documentdb  type discriminator, schemaVersion, queryable timestamp,
                  secondary index exists, queried field is indexed
check_engine      query is not a full scan, scan amplification is low
check_source      connection options set explicitly, TLS not hardcoded off,
                  client is not constructed per request
```

That is the benchmark working as intended: it measures best practices, not
basic competence.

### Three real bugs the controls found

None of these would have been caught by inspection, and all three would have
produced a *wrong published number*:

| Bug | Consequence | Now guarded by |
|---|---|---|
| `check_source.py` regex had catastrophic backtracking (nested quantifiers over lines) | verifier **hung for minutes** on a 6 KB file; replaced with `ast` (~1000× faster) | a CI test banning quantified-group-followed-by-quantifier |
| Credential check matched an f-string **template** (`mongodb://{quote_plus(user)}:{quote_plus(password)}@…`) | **failed the reference implementation** — a false positive would fail every correct submission | a CI test asserting env-driven URIs pass and real secrets still fail |
| Singleton check only looked inside route handlers | the naive app hid its per-request client in a helper and **passed** | a CI test with the exact helper pattern |

The third was found by the naive-submission control, which is precisely what
negative controls are for.

## What is *not* here

- **The skills themselves.** They live in [`skills/`](../../skills/). This
  benchmark measures obedience to them; it does not own them.
- **The fast development loops.** `testing/` (deterministic) and `evals/`
  (cross-model) are for iteration; see [`docs/TESTING.md`](../../docs/TESTING.md).
  This is the slow, hermetic publication layer.
