"""Aggregate route-efficiency runs into the comparison table.

THE RULE THIS ENFORCES
----------------------
Cost is compared **only among runs that reached parity**. A route that is
cheaper because it answered wrong has saved nothing, and averaging its tokens in
would manufacture a saving out of a failure. Runs that missed parity are counted
and reported — they are the more interesting result — but excluded from the cost
means.

That is the single most important difference from the `token-tests/` estimate it
replaces, which had no notion of correctness at all: it compared payload sizes
whether or not either route would have produced the right answer.
