## 2026-05-27 — Track upstream rename: `ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED_STDIO` → `TRUST_LOCAL_STDIO`

Upstream [microsoft/documentdb-mcp#83](https://github.com/microsoft/documentdb-mcp/pull/83)
renamed `ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED_STDIO` to `TRUST_LOCAL_STDIO`. The old name is
no longer recognized — server builds at `main` silently ignore it. The kit's
installer kept working only because it also sets `AUTH_REQUIRED=false`, which
short-circuits the Entra startup-validator before `TRUST_LOCAL_STDIO` is ever
consulted. Renamed everywhere so future readers don't see a dead env var:

- `install.sh` — `build_env_json()` (both python and jq paths)
- `install.ps1` — `Get-EnvJsonHashtable()`
- `mcp.json`
- `skills/mcp-setup/SKILL.md` — Step 3, config template, troubleshooting
- `README.md` — troubleshooting table

Also fixed a small but real correctness issue in the upstream-installed
"Install in VS Code" badge: it sets `TRUST_LOCAL_STDIO=true` and `TRANSPORT=stdio`
but omits `AUTH_REQUIRED=false`. Because the server's `validateConfig` runs
before the transport switch and demands `ENTRA_TENANT_ID` / `ENTRA_AUDIENCE`
whenever `AUTH_REQUIRED=true` (the default), the install-button config exits
at startup with "AUTH_REQUIRED=true requires ENTRA_TENANT_ID to be set." A
separate PR upstream fixes both the validator (skip the Entra check when
`TRANSPORT=stdio` and `TRUST_LOCAL_STDIO=true`) and the badge URL.

## 2026-05-21 — Cross-client installer: skills + DocumentDB MCP server in one command

Replaced the non-functional `npx skills add Azure/documentdb-agent-kit`
placeholder with real installers (`install.sh` for macOS/Linux, `install.ps1`
for Windows / cross-platform PowerShell) that, in one command, wire both the
kit's skills and the [`microsoft/documentdb-mcp`](https://github.com/microsoft/documentdb-mcp)
server into every detected client.

What landed:

- **`install.sh`** — POSIX bash installer, zero runtime deps beyond `git` +
  Node 20+. Auto-detects Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, GitHub Copilot
  CLI, and Gemini CLI; clones+builds the MCP server into
  `~/.documentdb-agent-kit/mcp-server/`; symlinks each skill into clients that
  support a skills directory; merges (idempotently) a single `DocumentDB` MCP
  entry into each client's JSON config with a timestamped `.bak` backup before
  every edit. Uses `python3` for JSON merging when available (universal on
  dev machines), falls back to `jq`.
- **`install.ps1`** — PowerShell 5.1+ / pwsh 7+ mirror. Same flow, native
  `ConvertFrom-Json` / `ConvertTo-Json` for merges. Falls back to copying skills
  when symlink creation requires Developer Mode / admin on Windows.
- **Flags on both:** `--uri`, `--yes`, `--dry-run`, `--uninstall`, `--clients`,
  `--skills-only`, `--mcp-only`, `--mcp-ref`, `--kit-ref`, `--profile`.
- **README rewrite** — install section now documents the one-liner, what gets
  installed where, requirements, flags, verify steps, uninstall, and a
  manual-install fallback.
- **`skills/mcp-setup/SKILL.md` rewrite** — the previous version told users to
  set `DOCUMENTDB_URI` in a shell profile, which is **not** how the current
  upstream MCP server is configured. Rewrote around the actual upstream
  contract: per-client MCP config file with `CONNECTION_PROFILES` JSON,
  `TRANSPORT=stdio`, `AUTH_REQUIRED=false`, and
  `ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED_STDIO=true` (later renamed `TRUST_LOCAL_STDIO` in
  [microsoft/documentdb-mcp#83](https://github.com/microsoft/documentdb-mcp/pull/83);
  this kit was updated to emit the new name in the 2026-05-27 entry below).
  Added per-client config-file table for
  Claude Code / Desktop / Cursor / Copilot CLI / Gemini CLI / VS Code.
  Updated AGENTS.md's mcp-setup row accordingly. Documented that
  `AUTH_REQUIRED` gates only the Entra-JWT bearer check on the MCP server's
  HTTP/SSE transport and is independent of MongoDB cluster auth (SCRAM /
  `authMode=entra`), TLS, and capability gates — `AUTH_REQUIRED=false` is
  safe only with `TRANSPORT=stdio`, and the same caveat is captured in the
  installer comments.

Verified end-to-end (Bash + PowerShell) in sandboxed `$HOME` against fake
client configs: existing MCP servers preserved, single- and multi-element
`args` arrays preserved across JSON round-trips, idempotent re-runs do not
duplicate the `DocumentDB` entry, uninstall removes only the kit's entries
and symlinks (foreign symlinks + other server entries untouched), and
`~/.documentdb-agent-kit/` is removed on uninstall.

## 2026-05-04 — Plugin manifests for Claude / Cursor / Codex / Gemini + bundled MCP server

The kit now ships as an installable plugin/extension for every major coding agent, bundling the [DocumentDB MCP server](https://github.com/microsoft/documentdb-mcp) (`documentdb-mcp-server` on npm) alongside the existing `skills/` tree. Users get skills + database tools in a single install command.

- New `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` + `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (Claude Code).
- New `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` (Cursor).
- New `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` with full interface metadata (display name, capabilities, default prompts, brand color `#0078D4`) + `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` for Codex marketplace discovery.
- New `gemini-extension.json` + `GEMINI.md` (Gemini CLI extension format; inlines the MCP server config because Gemini extensions don't reference an external `mcp.json`).
- New root `mcp.json` shared by Claude / Cursor / Codex: launches `documentdb-mcp-server` over stdio via `npx`, with `ENABLE_READ_TOOLS=true` and write/management tools opt-in. Backend access flows through the `DOCUMENTDB_CONNECTION_PROFILES` env var consumed by the server's connection-profile resolver.
- New `assets/logo.jpg` referenced from the Cursor and Codex manifests.
- Author email `mongodb-feedback@microsoft.com` set across the Claude / Cursor / Codex manifests.
- `README.md` slimmed to install + configuration only; capability catalog moved to new `docs/SKILLS.md` so coding agents doing top-level file scans focus on `README.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `GEMINI.md` and skill loading remains driven by `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` frontmatter via the plugin manifest.
- README now documents the universal `npx skills add Azure/documentdb-agent-kit` one-liner (skills.sh) for skills-only installs that don't need the MCP server.
- `AGENTS.md` cross-tool compatibility section rewritten as a per-agent install table covering Claude, Cursor, Codex, Gemini, Copilot, and skills-only.

## 2026-04-21 — `full-text-search`: corrected to `createSearchIndexes` + `$search` syntax; added analyzer rules

Previous rules documented the community MongoDB shape (`createIndexes` with `{ field: "textSearch" }` keys and a `count` field inside `$search`). Azure DocumentDB full-text search actually uses:

- `runCommand({ createSearchIndexes: "<col>", indexes: [{ name, definition: { mappings: { dynamic, fields }, analyzers? } }] })` for index creation
- `$search: { index: "<name>", text|phrase: { query, path } }` + a downstream `{ $limit: N }` stage (no `count` field)
- Index names referenced explicitly in `$search` because the engine does not auto-pick when multiple exist

Rule changes:

- Renamed `fts-create-textsearch-index.md` → **`fts-create-search-index.md`**; rewrote with `createSearchIndexes` / `definition.mappings` and `dynamic: false` guidance.
- Rewrote `fts-basic-search.md`, `fts-fuzzy-search.md`, `fts-phrase-search.md`, `fts-hybrid-search.md` to use the correct syntax (no `count`, uses `$limit`, specifies `index`).
- New **`fts-custom-analyzers.md`** — index-time `edgeGram` + search-time plain `keyword` analyzer pair for case-insensitive prefix matching on SKUs / part numbers / codes, with `lowerCase` + `asciiFolding` token filter ordering.
- New **`fts-path-hierarchy.md`** — `pathHierarchy` tokenizer for hierarchical identifiers (`BN-747-ENG-2024.05`, dotted paths, slash paths).
- New **`fts-multifield-index.md`** — single search index mapping multiple ID-like fields; fan-out-and-merge pattern while `$search` `compound` (`should` / `minimumShouldMatch`) is not yet supported.
- Updated SKILL.md front-matter and rule list; expanded the top-level README FTS row to reflect the broader surface.
- Fixed cross-references using the old syntax elsewhere in the kit: `skills/indexing/index-text-prefer-textsearch.md` (rewrote to use `createSearchIndexes`; refreshed related-rules links), `skills/indexing/index-pattern-cookbook.md` (recipe 14 now uses `createSearchIndexes` + `$limit`), `skills/query-optimizer/references/core-indexing-principles.md` (table + special-indexes section), and `AGENTS.md` (skill row + intro sentence).

## 2026-04-21 — `azure-deployment`: interactive subscription / RG / region pickers

- `SKILL.md` now requires the agent to **list subscriptions first, then resource groups, then regions** (only if creating a new RG). These are now Steps 1, 2, and 3; the remaining cluster inputs moved to Step 4 and deployment paths to Step 6. The previous single "gather inputs" table collapsed these into one prompt, which made agents silently assume the active subscription.
- `examples/azure-deployment/deploy.sh` and `deploy.ps1` implement the same flow interactively:
  1. Ensure `az` is installed and signed in
  2. List enabled subscriptions; auto-pick when there's only one, otherwise prompt
  3. Register the `Microsoft.DocumentDB` provider on the chosen subscription
  4. List existing resource groups (+ an explicit "create new" menu entry); derive location from the chosen RG when reusing
  5. Only prompt for a region if creating a new RG, using the `mongoClusters`-supported list
  6. Summarise defaults, confirm, deploy
- Both scripts now accept **zero positional arguments** (`./deploy.sh`) for fully interactive runs; passing `<rg> <location> [params-file]` still works and skips the relevant pickers.

## 2026-04-21 — `azure-deployment`: production-safe defaults (M30 + ZoneRedundant HA + 128 GiB) with dev parameters file and confirmation prompt

## 2026-04-21 — Added `documentdb-azure-deployment` skill

- New `skills/azure-deployment/` interactive workflow skill for provisioning an Azure DocumentDB cluster end-to-end. Grounded in Microsoft Learn docs for `Microsoft.DocumentDB/mongoClusters` (API `2025-09-01`).
- `SKILL.md` walks the agent through: a **Step 0 preflight loop** (CLI installed, signed in, correct subscription, `Microsoft.DocumentDB` registered, caller has Contributor/Owner, region supports `mongoClusters`), input gathering (tier, storage, HA, firewall posture), choosing a deployment path (Bicep / CLI one-shot / Terraform / portal), deployment, verification, connection-string retrieval, firewall / Private Endpoint posture, and teardown.
- `references/bicep-cluster-template.md` contains the canonical parameterized `main.bicep` with `@allowed` tier list, Key Vault password reference example, and an optional Private Endpoint variant (`publicNetworkAccess: 'Disabled'` + `Microsoft.Network/privateEndpoints` with group `MongoCluster`).
- New `examples/azure-deployment/` — a no-agent ready-to-run copy: `main.bicep`, `main.parameters.sample.json` (with Key Vault secret reference), `deploy.sh` (bash + preflight checks + auto-registers provider + creates RG), `deploy.ps1` (PowerShell equivalent), and `README.md`. Lets customers clone the repo and `./deploy.sh <rg> <location>` without involving any agent.
- Registered in `AGENTS.md` (skills table + routing hint) and `README.md`. Validator passes: 16 skills, unique names.

## 2026-04-21 — Added `documentdb-indexing` rule-folder skill

- New `skills/indexing/` skill (11 rules) dedicated to **index-type selection and shape** — answers "which index should I create?", complementing `documentdb-query-optimizer` (which answers "why is my query slow?").
- Rules: `index-single-field`, `index-compound-esr` (with DocumentDB's 32-field compound limit and the prefix rule), `index-multikey-arrays` (parallel-array restriction, `$elemMatch`, no covered queries), `index-text-prefer-textsearch` (prefer DocumentDB `textSearch` over community `$text`), `index-wildcard-dynamic-schemas`, `index-hashed-shard-keys`, `index-2dsphere-geospatial` (`[lng, lat]` order), `index-ttl-expiry` (Date field, single-field only, ~60s sweeper lag), `index-count-budget` (5–15 per collection), `index-lifecycle-drop-hide` (`$indexStats` → `hideIndex` → `dropIndex`, redundancy detection, `_id` cannot be dropped), `index-pattern-cookbook` (16 query-pattern → index-shape recipes).
- Registered skill in `AGENTS.md` (skills table + routing hint) and `README.md` (rule-folder skills table).

## 2026-04-21 — Cross-tool compatibility pass

- Added a `SKILL.md` with `name` + `description` YAML front matter to every rule-folder skill (`data-modeling`, `cluster-sharding`, `query-optimization`, `driver`, `vector-search`, `full-text-search`, `high-availability`, `security`, `monitoring`, `local-deployment`). All 14 skills are now discoverable by Agent Skills–compatible tools.
- Rewrote `AGENTS.md` as a proper skills index with a "how agents should use this kit" section, a full skills table (rule collections + interactive skills), and routing hints mapping user intents to skills.
- Added per-tool install instructions to `README.md` (Claude Code project + user scope, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI).
- Added `scripts/validate-skills.ps1` — verifies every `skills/*/SKILL.md` has valid front matter with non-empty `name` and `description`, and that names are unique across the kit.

## 2026-04-21 — Merged `indexing/` rules into `query-optimizer/references/`

- Moved `skills/indexing/index-support-queries.md` into `skills/query-optimizer/references/`.
- Removed the standalone `skills/indexing/` rule folder — compound-index guidance now lives with the query-optimizer skill that loads it.
- Added `skills/query-optimizer/references/core-indexing-principles.md` — the deep-dive referenced from the skill's `SKILL.md` (supported index types, ESR rule, reading `explain("executionStats")`, covered queries, common diagnoses, anti-patterns, special index categories, verification workflow).
- Updated `README.md` to reflect both rule-folder and standalone-SKILL.md skill types.

## 2026-04-21 — Flattened skill layout

- Removed the `skills/documentdb-best-practices/` wrapper and the intermediate `rules/` folder.
- Every category folder (`data-modeling`, `cluster-sharding`, `indexing`, `query-optimization`, `driver`, `vector-search`, `full-text-search`, `high-availability`, `security`, `monitoring`, `local-deployment`) now lives directly under `skills/`.
- Updated top-level `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` to reference the new paths.
- No rule files were renamed or modified.

## 2026-04-22 — Added Local Deployment category

- New `rules/local-deployment/` folder with 7 best-practice rules for running DocumentDB locally: choosing the right image (Gateway vs psql vs source), `docker-compose.yml` patterns, TLS + SCRAM connection config, env-driven configuration (`DOCUMENTDB_URI`, `DOCUMENTDB_ALLOW_INVALID_CERTS`), sample-data management (`SKIP_INIT_DATA` / `INIT_DATA_PATH`), port bindings (`127.0.0.1` only), and local/production parity via versioned index & seed scripts.
- Registered the new category in `SKILL.md`, `metadata.json`, and the skill README.

## 2026-04-22 — Added Full-Text Search category

- New `rules/full-text-search/` folder with 5 rules covering the `textSearch` index type and the `$search` aggregation stage: index creation, BM25 keyword search, fuzzy search (`maxEdits`), phrase search (`slop`), and hybrid (BM25 + vector) search via Reciprocal Rank Fusion.
- Registered the new category in `SKILL.md`, `metadata.json`, and the skill README.

## 2026-04-22 — Grouped rules into category subfolders

- Rules are now organized one folder per category under `rules/` (e.g. `rules/vector-search/`, `rules/cluster-sharding/`, `rules/security/`).
- Updated SKILL.md links accordingly. File names (and rule prefixes) are unchanged.

## 2026-04-21 — Retargeted to Azure DocumentDB (v0.2.0)

- Kit now targets **Azure DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility)** — the managed service built on the open-source DocumentDB project.
- Rewrote Sharding rules around DocumentDB's sharding model (shard key not required until terabytes).
- Rewrote Vector rules to reflect DocumentDB's `cosmosSearch` with **DiskANN** (recommended), HNSW, and IVF; added Product Quantization and Half-Precision indexing rules.
- Updated HA rules with the documented SLAs (99.99% HA, 99.995% HA + cross-region replica).
- Removed Full-Text Search category (not a first-class DocumentDB feature).

## 2026-04-21 — Initial scaffold (v0.1.0)

- Created `documentdb-best-practices` skill targeting Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore (later retargeted).
